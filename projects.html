                <a href="" target="_blank">Stand With Hong Kong</a>
                <p>I knew for my final project with General Assembly, I wanted to build a news site.
                    I have been following the protests in Hong Kong since they started in March 2019. The news is
                    getting more and more brutal every week.
                    It seemed logical that I use my skills to create a news site and bring awareness about the
                    protests.
                    With the Hong Kong protesters now calling for the United State’s aid, I included a “Help”
                    section that gives information on how as US citizen we can support the protestors.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Stand with Hong Kong is a full stack MERN site. The backend uses Mongoose, Express, and Node.
                    The data comes from newsapi.org’s free service with a limit of 500 news articles a month.
                    I maxed the article limit out for this project. The frontend uses React’s class components, and
                    is styled using ‘styled-components.’
                    My goal was to build a striking, easy to use website.

                    MrsRvr provides Rover images and weather data. For this project I
                    created and deployed the entire
                    backend for the website.
                    MrsRvr is a MERN site. I used Mongoose, Express, and Node to deploy the backend.

                <p>My experience in consulting with Talent Acquisition teams inspired my Jobs API. This API
                    links Job Titles wiht
                    coresponding SOC codes, and suggests alternative titles based off of that code.
